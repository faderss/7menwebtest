        <h2>About the group:</h2>
        <p>On March 5th 2018, Johnny's club member fans received information in the mail hinting at the formation of a new unit that would perform with HiHi Jets and 東京B少年 (now known as Bishonen) at that year's Johnny's Ginza. In the April edition of Duet and Winkup fan magazine, the unit's name and members were introduced for the first time.</p>
        <p>At that time, the group was made up of 7 members, Nakamura Reia, Motodaka Katsuki, Sugeta Rinne, Konno Taiki, Sasaki Taiko, Maeda Koki, Igarashi Reo.</p>
        <p>On April 13th, the group performed for the first time on The Shounen Club performing Take Me Higher alongside HiHi Jets and 東京B少年. While mainly acting as backdancers, they performed with skateboards - hinting at the theme of their group.</p>
        <p>In December of 2018, rumors of Maeda Koki leaving Johnny's Entertainment began to circulate when he did not appear with the other 6 members of the unit in that month's edition of Myojo magazine.</p>
        <p>In 2019, Yabana Rei was added to the unit, confirming Maeda Koki's departure.</p>
        <p>On March 1st, they were introduced as one of 11 units regularly participating in Johnny's Jr. official entertainment website 'ISLAND TV.'</p>
        <p>Around May 18th, 2019 a video of him appeared on instagram and spread throughout social media of him underaged smoking with girls who were also underaged. While the video wasn't clear, he stopped making appearances with 7 MEN 侍. On May 27th fans noticed Igarashi being excluded off 7MEN侍 goods (Uchiwa and straps) and photos.</p>
        <p>On May 29th, Igarashi has been reported to have left Johnny's Entertainment and his profile, photos and any videos of him were removed off ISLAND TV.</p>
        <p>Since then, the group has been working as 6 members.</p>
